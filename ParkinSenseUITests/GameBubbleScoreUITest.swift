    override func setUp() {
        // Put setup code here. This method is called before the invocation of each test method in the class.

        // In UI tests it is usually best to stop immediately when a failure occurs.

        // UI tests must launch the application that they test. Doing this in setup will make sure it happens for each test method.

        // In UI tests itâ€™s important to set the initial state - such as interface orientation - required for your tests before they run. The setUp method is a good place to do this.

        // Put teardown code here. This method is called after the invocation of each test method in the class.
    }

    func testExample() {
        // Use recording to get started writing UI tests.
        // Use XCTAssert and related functions to verify your tests produce the correct results.
